The work involved experimenting with AI-based tools, such as D-ID, to generate expressive facial animations and enhance the avatar’s narrative potential. The process also required visual refinement, consistency checks and adjustments to ensure coherence between personality, aesthetic choices and the intended communication purpose. The final result is a stylized representation that balances creativity, technology and design principles.",

The work required structuring pedagogical content into four modules—solar energy, energy storage systems, the Iberian electricity market (OMIE), and intelligent monitoring strategies—while ensuring conceptual clarity and accessibility for a broad online audience. The project included video production, interactive elements developed in Genially, and adapted 3D space explorations using Matterport. It also demanded strong planning and team coordination, especially when managing unforeseen constraints such as the inability to perform on-site photogrammetry. All materials were ultimately integrated and published on Udemy, where the course was tested and evaluated by users. The final result is a well-structured learning experience that reflects both pedagogical design and multimedia production skills.",
